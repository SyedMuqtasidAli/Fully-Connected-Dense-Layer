## Introduction 📘
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It utilizes a densely connected neural network to perform single-label multi-class classification, accurately identifying digits from 0 to 9.

## Features ✨
- **Model Architecture:** Densely connected neural network.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Scripts for training and evaluating the model.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing the model's predictions and performance metrics.

## Installation ⚙️
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-handwritten-digit-classification.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd mnist-handwritten-digit-classification
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage 🚀
To run the Jupyter Notebook and start training the model, follow these steps:
