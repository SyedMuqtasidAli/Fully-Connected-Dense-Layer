## Introduction
This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It utilizes a densely connected neural network to perform single-label multi-class classification, accurately identifying digits from 0 to 9.

## Features
- **Model Architecture:** Densely connected neural network.
- **Training and Evaluation:** Scripts for training and evaluating the model.
- **Visualization:** Tools for visualizing the model's predictions and performance metrics.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist-handwritten-digit-classification.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd mnist-handwritten-digit-classification
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
To run the Jupyter Notebook and start training the model, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter installed. If not, install it using:
    ```sh
    pip install jupyter
    ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```sh
    jupyter notebook Untitled9.ipynb
    ```

3. Follow the instructions within the notebook to load data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
